Monster Maze Console Game


Seeking inspiration for a Halloween post I came across Peter Pravos' [Celebrate Halloween with Creepy Computer Games in R](https://lucidmanager.org/data-science/creepy-computer-games-in-r/).

Following his example I decided to translate into R one of the other creepy games in the book [Creepy Computer Games (Usborne, London)](https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books). This book and many other wonders are available in the previous link. 
The book collection has been a completely unexpected discovery, I am really thankful to Peter for such an interesting series in his blog.

The books are richly coloured with beautiful illustrations everywhere. There is a big contrast between the illustrations and the simple graphics of the games in [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) and [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro). I was considering if the book was trying to compensate somehow, but now I just think that the same imagination that was powering the illustrations was also behind the graphics, so the  contrast is due to the different degree of development of the the tools. 


For this occasion I have selected "Ghost Maze" written by Colin Reynolds.
